### Task 1.1: Design Environment Isolation Strategy
**Agent**: @agent-mycelium-core:platform-engineer
**Status**: LAUNCHED
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Started**: 2025-10-13
**Effort**: 4 hours

**Objective**: Design comprehensive isolation strategy covering all layers (shell, runtime, wrapper scripts)

**Context**:
- This is the FOUNDATION task that all other M01 tasks depend on
- Must define the complete environment variable schema
- Must specify XDG directory usage patterns
- Must design activation/deactivation flows
- Must address edge cases and failure modes

**Requirements Reference** (from M01 milestone):
- **FR-1**: Isolate from system Python, no PATH pollution, concurrent project support
- **FR-2**: Project-local (.mycelium/) and user-global (XDG) config with precedence
- **FR-3**: Automatic (direnv) and manual activation with clear indication
- **TR-1**: XDG spec compliance (~/.config, ~/.local/share, ~/.cache, ~/.local/state)
- **TR-2**: Linux, macOS, Windows (WSL2) support
- **TR-3**: Multi-layer validation (shell, runtime, wrapper)
- **IR-1**: Integration with uv package manager
- **CR-1-4**: No system modifications, no sudo, minimal dependencies

**Deliverables**:
1. **Design Document** (`docs/design/environment-isolation-strategy.md`)

   Must include:
   - **Environment Variables Specification**
     * All variables to be set (MYCELIUM_*)
     * Purpose and usage of each variable
     * Default values and overrides
     * Required vs optional variables

   - **XDG Directory Structure**
     * Config: ~/.config/mycelium/ (what goes here)
     * Data: ~/.local/share/mycelium/ (what goes here)
     * Cache: ~/.cache/mycelium/ (what goes here)
     * State: ~/.local/state/mycelium/ (what goes here)
     * Project: .mycelium/ (what goes here)

   - **Activation Flow Design**
     * direnv activation process
     * Manual activation process
     * Virtual environment activation
     * PATH modification strategy
     * Shell prompt modification

   - **Deactivation Flow Design**
     * Environment cleanup steps
     * State restoration process
     * Nested activation handling

   - **Edge Cases & Failure Modes**
     * Missing directories
     * Permission issues
     * Nested activations
     * Concurrent project activations
     * Platform-specific issues
     * Recovery procedures

   - **Validation Strategy**
     * Layer 1: Shell-level validation
     * Layer 2: Runtime validation
     * Layer 3: Wrapper script validation
     * Error messages and user guidance

   - **Integration Points**
     * uv virtual environment integration
     * Future slash command integration
     * Config system integration (M02)
     * Service detection integration (M03)

2. **Activation Flow Diagram** (ASCII or Mermaid)
   - Visual representation of activation sequence
   - Decision points and branches
   - Error handling paths

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All environment variables defined with clear purposes
- [ ] XDG directory usage specified for each directory type
- [ ] Activation flow covers both direnv and manual methods
- [ ] Deactivation flow properly restores environment
- [ ] Edge cases identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Design reviewed by devops-engineer (implementation perspective)
- [ ] Design reviewed by python-pro (runtime integration perspective)
- [ ] Platform-specific considerations documented

**Review Process**:
1. Self-review: Check completeness against acceptance criteria
2. Peer review: devops-engineer reviews shell script feasibility
3. Peer review: python-pro reviews Python integration approach
4. Revision: Address feedback and update design
5. Final approval: Get sign-off from both reviewers

**Success Metrics**:
- Design is comprehensive enough that Task 1.2-1.6 can proceed without major revisions
- Reviewers confirm the design is implementable
- No blockers or unknowns remain for downstream tasks

**Instructions**:
1. Read M01 milestone document completely
2. Analyze all requirements (FR, TR, IR, CR)
3. Research XDG Base Directory Specification
4. Research direnv best practices
5. Design environment variable schema
6. Design directory structure and content mapping
7. Design activation/deactivation flows
8. Identify edge cases and failure modes
9. Document integration points with other components
10. Create flow diagrams
11. Request reviews from devops-engineer and python-pro
12. Iterate based on feedback
13. Get final approval

**Estimated Completion**: 2025-10-13 (4 hours)

**Blocks**: Tasks 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 (all other M01 tasks)

## Coordination Notes

### Parallel Execution
- **P1.1** (Project Planning) and **1.1** (Design Strategy) launched in parallel
- These tasks are independent and can proceed simultaneously
- Project planning will incorporate design decisions once 1.1 completes

### Next Wave of Tasks
After Task 1.1 completes and passes reviews:

**Wave 2** (Single task, blocks Wave 3):
- **Task 1.2**: Implement XDG Directory Structure (@agent-mycelium-core:python-pro)
  - Dependencies: Task 1.1 complete
  - Effort: 6 hours
  - Blocks: Tasks 1.3, 1.4, 1.6

**Wave 3** (Three parallel tasks):
- **Task 1.3**: Create direnv Integration (@agent-mycelium-core:platform-engineer)
  - Dependencies: Task 1.2 complete
  - Effort: 8 hours
  - Can run in parallel with 1.4 and 1.6

- **Task 1.4**: Shell Activation Scripts (@agent-mycelium-core:devops-engineer)
  - Dependencies: Task 1.2 complete
  - Effort: 6 hours
  - Can run in parallel with 1.3 and 1.6

- **Task 1.6**: Project-Local Config Support (@agent-mycelium-core:platform-engineer)
  - Dependencies: Task 1.2 complete
  - Effort: 4 hours
  - Can run in parallel with 1.3 and 1.4

**Wave 4** (Single task, depends on Wave 3):
- **Task 1.5**: Runtime Environment Validation (@agent-mycelium-core:python-pro)
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1.2, 1.4 complete
  - Effort: 6 hours

**Wave 5** (Final integration):
- **Task 1.7**: Integration Testing & Documentation (@agent-mycelium-core:platform-engineer + test-automator)
  - Dependencies: Tasks 1.1-1.6 all complete
  - Effort: 6 hours

### Coordination Metrics

**Current Status**:
- Active agents: 2
- Tasks in progress: 2
- Tasks blocked: 5
- Tasks complete: 0
- Overall completion: 0%

**Timeline**:
- Day 1 (2025-10-13): Tasks P1.1, 1.1, 1.2
- Day 2 (2025-10-14): Tasks 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
- Day 3 (2025-10-15): Task 1.7, integration, milestone completion

### Communication Protocol

**Status Updates**:
- Agents should update this document when tasks complete
- Use standardized status: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, REVIEW, COMPLETE
- Include actual time spent vs estimate

**Blocker Escalation**:
- Blockers should be noted immediately in task status
- Coordinator (multi-agent-coordinator) will help resolve blockers
- Critical blockers that affect timeline escalated to project-manager

**Handoffs**:
- When task completes, notify dependent task agents
- Provide path to deliverables
- Highlight any deviations from design/plan

### Resource Coordination

**Agent Workload**:
- platform-engineer: Tasks 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7 (lead) = 22 hours
- python-pro: Tasks 1.2, 1.5 = 12 hours
- devops-engineer: Task 1.4 = 6 hours
- test-automator: Task 1.7 (support) = 2 hours
- project-manager: Task P1.1 = 4 hours

**Bottleneck Analysis**:
- platform-engineer is critical path (22 hours across 3 days)
- Must ensure platform-engineer tasks don't overlap too much
- Consider delegating parts of 1.7 more heavily to test-automator

### Success Criteria for Phase 1

**Project Planning (P1.1)**:
- [ ] Clear timeline with dates
- [ ] All task dependencies documented
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined
- [ ] Tracking structure established

**Design Strategy (1.1)**:

- [ ] XDG directory usage specified
- [ ] Activation/deactivation flows documented
- [ ] Edge cases addressed
- [ ] Reviewed by devops-engineer and python-pro
- [ ] Final approval received

**Phase 1 Complete When**:
