## Coordination Strategy

### Parallel Execution Rationale

Tasks P1.1 and 1.1 can proceed in parallel because:
- **Independent Work Streams**: Project planning and technical design don't have direct dependencies
- **Different Expertise**: project-manager focuses on process, platform-engineer on technical architecture
- **Complementary Outcomes**: Project plan will incorporate design decisions once 1.1 completes
- **Risk Reduction**: If design reveals unexpected complexity, project plan can be adjusted early

### Critical Path Analysis

**Current Critical Path**: Task 1.1 → 1.2 → 1.3 → 1.7

Task 1.1 is the critical bottleneck:
- Blocks ALL other technical tasks
- Must be reviewed and approved before proceeding
- Quality here determines quality of all downstream work
- Estimated 4 hours, but may need iteration based on review feedback

**Risk**: If Task 1.1 takes longer than 4 hours or requires significant revisions after review, it will delay the entire milestone.

**Mitigation**:
- platform-engineer is milestone lead (most experienced)
- Comprehensive context provided in task brief
- Review process built in to catch issues early
- Coordinator (multi-agent-coordinator) monitoring progress

### Upcoming Task Waves

**Wave 2** (Launches after 1.1 completes + reviews):
- Task 1.2: XDG Directory Implementation (python-pro, 6 hours)
  - Single task, blocks Wave 3
  - Core Python infrastructure

**Wave 3** (Launches after 1.2 completes):
- Task 1.3: direnv Integration (platform-engineer, 8 hours)
- Task 1.4: Shell Scripts (devops-engineer, 6 hours)
- Task 1.6: Config Loader (platform-engineer, 4 hours)
  - Three parallel tasks
  - Maximum resource utilization

**Wave 4** (Launches after 1.2 and 1.4 complete):
- Task 1.5: Runtime Validation (python-pro, 6 hours)
  - Depends on specific prior tasks
  - Can overlap with end of Wave 3

**Wave 5** (Final integration):
- Task 1.7: Integration Testing (platform-engineer + test-automator, 6 hours)
  - Requires all tasks 1.1-1.6 complete
  - Milestone completion

## Resource Allocation

### Agent Workload Distribution

| Agent | Tasks | Total Effort | Tasks by Wave |
|-------|-------|--------------|---------------|
| platform-engineer | 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7 (lead) | 22 hours | W1, W3(x2), W5 |
| python-pro | 1.2, 1.5 | 12 hours | W2, W4 |
| devops-engineer | 1.4 | 6 hours | W3 |
| test-automator | 1.7 (support) | 2 hours | W5 |
| project-manager | P1.1 | 4 hours | W1 |

### Bottleneck Analysis

**platform-engineer** is the most loaded resource:
- 22 hours of work across 3-day milestone
- Leads 4 out of 7 technical tasks
- On critical path (tasks 1.1, 1.3, 1.7)

**Mitigation strategies**:
- Task 1.6 (4 hours) could be delegated if platform-engineer becomes overloaded
- Task 1.7 test automation support can be expanded to test-automator
- Careful scheduling to avoid parallel platform-engineer tasks where possible

**python-pro** well-balanced:
- 12 hours across 2 tasks
- Natural gaps between tasks (Wave 2 and Wave 4)
- Can provide review support during idle time

**devops-engineer** underutilized:
- Only 6 hours on Task 1.4
- Available for reviews of Tasks 1.1, 1.3
- Could take over Task 1.6 if needed

## Coordination Monitoring

### Progress Tracking

**Coordination document**: `/home/gerald/git/mycelium/docs/projects/onboarding/coordination/M01_ACTIVE_TASKS.md`

This document serves as the single source of truth for:
- Task status and progress
- Agent assignments
- Blockers and issues
- Completion metrics
- Handoff coordination

**Update frequency**: Agents should update task status upon:
- Task start
- Significant progress (e.g., 50% complete)
- Blockers encountered
- Review requests
- Task completion

### Coordination Checkpoints

**4 hours from launch** (2025-10-13):
- Check if P1.1 and 1.1 are on track
- Assess if review process for 1.1 can begin
- Identify any blockers

**8 hours from launch** (2025-10-13):
- P1.1 should be complete
- Task 1.1 should be in review
- Prepare to launch Task 1.2

**End of Day 1** (2025-10-13):
- Task 1.1 should be approved
- Task 1.2 should be launched or nearly complete
- Project plan should be finalized

**Daily thereafter**: Morning coordination check at start of each day

### Communication Channels

**Status updates**: Update M01_ACTIVE_TASKS.md

**Blocker escalation**:
1. Note blocker in task status immediately
2. Notify multi-agent-coordinator
3. For critical path blockers, also notify project-manager

**Handoffs**:
1. Complete task deliverables
2. Update task status to COMPLETE
3. Notify dependent task agents with paths to deliverables
4. Highlight any deviations from design
