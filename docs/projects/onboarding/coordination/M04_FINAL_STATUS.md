## Integration Points for Future Milestones

### M05: Deployment Generation (Ready)
The wizard creates complete configurations that M05 will use to generate deployment files.

**Will provide**:
- Complete `MyceliumConfig` object with all services configured
- Deployment method selection (Docker Compose vs Justfile)
- Service ports and resource limits
- Project metadata for deployment customization

**M05 will use**:
- `config.deployment.method` to choose template
- `config.services.*` to generate service definitions
- `config.project_name` for deployment naming
- Port configurations to avoid conflicts

### Integration Flow:
```
M04 (init) → config.yaml → M05 (generate) → docker-compose.yml/Justfile
```

## Risks & Issues

### Resolved
- ✅ UX complexity (progressive disclosure and clear help text)
- ✅ Terminal compatibility (tested on multiple terminals, fallback to plain text)
- ✅ Resume state corruption (atomic writes, validation, backup)
- ✅ Input validation (Pydantic validators, clear error messages)
- ✅ Cross-platform differences (abstraction layer, platform detection)
- ✅ Accessibility concerns (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)

### Outstanding
- 🟡 Windows native testing (WSL2 tested, native Windows needs validation)
- 🟡 Fish shell compatibility (bash/zsh tested, fish deferred)

### Mitigated
- Non-interactive mode enables CI/CD usage
- Clear error messages guide users to solutions
- Resume functionality prevents data loss
- Comprehensive documentation covers edge cases

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Phased Approach** - Breaking into 3 phases (design, implementation, integration) prevented rework
2. **Building on M01-M03** - Strong foundation enabled rapid, high-quality implementation
3. **User-Centered Design** - Starting with UX design (Task 4.1) ensured excellent user experience
4. **Rich Terminal UI** - InquirerPy and Rich provided beautiful, accessible interface
5. **Comprehensive Testing** - 231 tests caught issues early, high confidence in quality
6. **Clear Dependencies** - Well-defined task boundaries prevented conflicts
7. **Resume Support** - Addressing interruption scenarios from the start improved UX

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Native Windows Testing** - WSL2 tested, but native Windows needs validation
2. **Fish Shell Support** - Deferred to later phase, could have included
3. **Performance Testing** - Could add benchmarks for wizard speed
4. **Localization** - Current implementation is English-only

### Recommendations for M05
1. Use phased approach: design templates → implement generators → test
2. Start with deployment template design before implementation
3. Test generated deployments on multiple platforms early
4. Create example deployments for validation
5. Maintain ≥90% test coverage target
6. Document deployment customization patterns
7. Consider supporting additional deployment methods (Helm, Terraform)
