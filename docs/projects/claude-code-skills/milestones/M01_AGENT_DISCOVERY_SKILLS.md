# M01: Agent Discovery & Coordination Skills

## Overview

**Duration:** 6 weeks (120 hours)
**Phase:** MLP (Minimum Lovable Product)
**Dependencies:** None (Project start milestone)
**Blocks:** M02 (Skill Infrastructure), M03 (Token Optimization), M04 (Orchestration)
**Lead Agent:** multi-agent-coordinator
**Support Agents:** ai-engineer, backend-developer, python-pro, qa-expert

## Why This Milestone

The Agent Discovery & Coordination Skills milestone establishes the foundational infrastructure that enables Claude Code to intelligently navigate and orchestrate Mycelium's 130+ specialized agents. Currently, the system relies on manual agent selection and lacks dynamic discovery capabilities, creating friction in multi-agent workflows and limiting the platform's ability to automatically compose optimal agent teams for complex tasks.

This milestone transforms Claude Code from a passive tool executor into an intelligent orchestrator that can discover relevant agents based on task requirements, coordinate handoffs between specialists, and maintain context throughout multi-agent workflows. By implementing real-time agent discovery with NLP-based capability matching, we enable Claude to automatically identify the right specialist for each subtask without requiring users to manually navigate agent directories or understand the full agent taxonomy.

The coordination infrastructure delivered in this milestone becomes the backbone for all future agent collaboration features. Without robust discovery and coordination primitives, advanced capabilities like token optimization (M03) and orchestration meta-skills (M04) would lack the coordination layer needed to function cohesively. This milestone's success directly determines whether Claude Code can evolve from a single-agent assistant into a true multi-agent system that leverages specialized expertise intelligently and transparently.

## Risks

### Risk 1: NLP Matching Accuracy Below Target

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High
**Description:** Semantic matching engine may not achieve >85% accuracy target for capability-to-agent mapping, resulting in poor agent recommendations and reduced user trust in discovery system.

**Mitigation:**
- Conduct early evaluation of multiple embedding models (sentence-transformers, OpenAI embeddings)
- Create comprehensive test dataset with diverse query types during Task 1.3
- Implement hybrid matching combining embedding similarity with keyword-based filtering
- Plan manual tuning phase for capability descriptions if accuracy insufficient
- Budget 8 additional hours for model selection and optimization if needed

**Contingency:**
- Fall back to rule-based matching with confidence degradation if NLP accuracy fails
- Provide explicit agent recommendation API allowing manual selection
- Document known limitations and suggest query refinement strategies

### Risk 2: State Management Complexity

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Description:** Managing state across multi-agent workflows with nested coordination and rollback scenarios may introduce bugs, data loss, or synchronization issues impacting workflow reliability.

**Mitigation:**
- Design state schema with immutability and versioning from start (Task 1.5)
- Implement comprehensive state validation and schema enforcement
- Create extensive unit tests covering edge cases (concurrent modifications, partial failures)
- Use proven state management patterns (event sourcing, CQRS) if complexity warrants
- Schedule technical review of state management design before implementation

**Contingency:**
- Simplify state management to support sequential-only workflows initially
- Defer parallel coordination and advanced rollback to M02 if timeline at risk
- Implement pessimistic locking to prevent concurrent state corruption
- Add state audit logging for debugging state-related issues

### Risk 3: Performance Degradation with Scale

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** High
**Description:** Discovery queries or coordination operations may not meet performance requirements (<100ms, <500ms) when registry grows beyond 130 agents or under high concurrent load.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement database indexing strategy during Task 1.1
- Cache embedding computations and frequently accessed metadata
- Conduct load testing early (Task 1.9) to identify bottlenecks
- Profile coordination code paths and optimize hot spots proactively
- Plan horizontal scaling strategy if vertical optimization insufficient

**Contingency:**
- Implement caching layer (Redis) for discovery queries if needed
- Add query result pagination to reduce response payload sizes
- Introduce rate limiting more aggressively if performance issues arise
- Document performance tuning guide for operations team

### Risk 4: Integration Breaking Changes

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium
**Description:** Discovery and coordination systems may require modifications to existing Mycelium infrastructure or agent implementations, creating integration complexity and potential regressions.

**Mitigation:**
- Design integration points with backward compatibility from start (IR-1.1)
- Create integration tests validating existing agent functionality unchanged
- Conduct integration review with backend team before Task 1.2
- Plan incremental rollout enabling gradual adoption by agents
- Maintain compatibility shims for deprecated interfaces during transition

**Contingency:**
- Implement feature flags enabling discovery/coordination opt-in per agent
- Create migration path with dual-mode support during transition period
- Budget 12 additional hours for integration fixes if breaking changes discovered
- Document migration guide for agents requiring updates

### Risk 5: Documentation Insufficiency

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Low
**Description:** Documentation may not provide sufficient guidance for developers to effectively use discovery and coordination skills, increasing support burden and reducing adoption.

**Mitigation:**
- Assign dedicated documentation task (Task 1.10) with clear acceptance criteria
- Include usage examples and troubleshooting guides in all API documentation
- Conduct documentation review with sample users (non-implementers) before completion
- Create quick start guide enabling skill usage in <15 minutes
- Plan documentation iteration based on early user feedback

**Contingency:**
- Schedule follow-up documentation sprint if initial version insufficient
- Create video tutorials demonstrating common workflows
- Implement in-tool help and contextual guidance for discovery/coordination operations
- Establish documentation feedback channel for continuous improvement
