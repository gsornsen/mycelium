# Milestone 2: Skill Infrastructure

## Overview

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Duration | 5 weeks (100 hours) |
| Phase | Dogfooding |
| Dependencies | M01 (Agent Discovery Skills) |
| Blocks | M03 (Skill Registry & Distribution) |
| Lead Agent | Infrastructure Architect |
| Supporting Agents | DevOps Engineer, Backend Developer, Security Analyst |

## Why This Milestone

The skill infrastructure represents the foundational architecture that enables Claude Code to dynamically load, execute, and manage skills across all agent contexts. While M01 established the agent discovery mechanisms and architectural patterns, M02 builds the runtime engine that brings those patterns to life. This milestone transforms the theoretical framework into a production-ready system capable of handling real-world workloads with security, performance, and reliability guarantees.

Building robust skill infrastructure at this stage is critical because every subsequent milestone depends on it. The infrastructure must support not only the agent discovery skills from M01 but also all future skills including code analysis, testing, deployment automation, and custom user-defined capabilities. Without a solid foundation for skill loading, lifecycle management, and execution sandboxing, the entire Claude Code Skills ecosystem would be built on unstable ground. This milestone ensures that skills can be safely loaded from multiple sources, properly validated, efficiently cached, and cleanly isolated during execution.

Furthermore, the infrastructure layer must be designed with extensibility and performance in mind from day one. As the skill ecosystem grows, the infrastructure needs to handle hundreds of skills across dozens of concurrent agent sessions without degrading performance or consuming excessive resources. By implementing proper dependency resolution, lazy loading strategies, and resource pooling mechanisms now, we establish patterns that will scale with the platform. This milestone also introduces the monitoring and observability foundations that will be essential for debugging skill interactions and optimizing performance as the system matures.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements (FR)

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Performance Degradation at Scale
**Severity:** High
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** System becomes unusable with many skills loaded

**Description:**
As the number of installed skills grows into the hundreds, the skill infrastructure may experience performance degradation due to inefficient indexing, excessive memory consumption, or slow search operations. This could make Claude Code unresponsive during skill discovery or loading.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Lazy Loading:** Implement aggressive lazy loading where only skill metadata is loaded initially, with code loaded on first use
2. **Indexing:** Use efficient search indexes (Lunr.js or similar) for metadata search
3. **Caching:** Implement multi-level caching (memory cache for hot skills, disk cache for cold skills)
4. **Performance Budgets:** Establish and enforce strict performance budgets in CI/CD (fail builds that exceed targets)
5. **Load Testing:** Regularly test with realistic skill loads (500+ skills) to catch regressions early
6. **Profiling:** Integrate continuous performance profiling in development and staging environments

**Contingency Plan:**
If performance issues arise post-deployment, implement emergency optimizations: disable auto-discovery by default, limit concurrent skill executions, add manual skill activation requirement.

### Risk 2: Security Vulnerabilities in Sandboxing
**Severity:** Critical
**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Malicious skills could compromise user systems

**Description:**
Despite implementing sandboxing, there may be vulnerabilities that allow malicious skills to escape isolation and access unauthorized resources. Node.js/V8 sandboxing is complex and historically has had vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security (sandbox + filesystem guards + network guards + process isolation)
2. **Security Audits:** Conduct professional security audits of sandboxing implementation before production release
3. **Allowlist Approach:** Default to denying all access; require explicit permission grants
4. **Code Signing:** Require GPG signatures for all skills from external sources
5. **Static Analysis:** Run automated security scanners on all skill code before execution
6. **Kill Switch:** Implement ability to remotely disable malicious skills across all installations
7. **Bug Bounty:** Establish bug bounty program for security researchers

**Contingency Plan:**
If sandbox escape is discovered, immediately release patch disabling affected skill types, notify all users, and provide security update. Maintain incident response runbook for security vulnerabilities.

### Risk 3: Dependency Hell and Version Conflicts
**Severity:** Medium
**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Skills fail to load due to incompatible dependencies

**Description:**
Skills may depend on different versions of the same libraries, creating version conflicts that prevent skills from loading together. This is especially problematic with global dependencies in Node.js that can only have one version loaded at a time.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Isolated Dependency Trees:** Each skill gets its own dependency tree (using npm workspaces or similar)
2. **Version Ranges:** Encourage flexible version ranges in skill manifests to maximize compatibility
3. **Conflict Detection:** Detect version conflicts early and provide clear error messages with resolution suggestions
4. **Dependency Deduplication:** Implement intelligent deduplication for compatible versions
5. **Documentation:** Provide clear guidelines for skill authors on dependency management
6. **Testing Matrix:** Test skills against multiple dependency versions in CI

**Contingency Plan:**
If widespread conflicts occur, implement emergency dependency isolation mode where each skill runs in completely separate process with own dependency tree (higher overhead but guaranteed compatibility).

### Risk 4: Breaking Changes Impacting M01 Skills
**Severity:** High
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** M01 skills stop working, breaking existing workflows

**Description:**
During infrastructure development, we may inadvertently introduce breaking changes that cause the M01 agent discovery skills to fail. This would block progress on subsequent milestones and frustrate early adopters.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Comprehensive Test Suite:** Maintain integration tests using all M01 skills as test fixtures
2. **CI/CD Checks:** Automatically run M01 skills in CI before merging any PR
3. **Semantic Versioning:** Strictly follow semver, marking breaking changes appropriately
4. **Compatibility Layer:** Implement compatibility shims for any unavoidable breaking changes
5. **Deprecation Warnings:** Provide early warning (2+ versions) before removing deprecated APIs
6. **Version Pinning:** Allow skills to pin infrastructure version requirements
7. **Documentation:** Maintain detailed migration guides for each major version

**Contingency Plan:**
If breaking changes slip through, immediately release hotfix with compatibility layer and extend deprecation timeline. Provide automated migration tool to update affected skills.

### Risk 5: Resource Exhaustion and Memory Leaks
**Severity:** Medium
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Claude Code becomes slow or crashes during long sessions

**Description:**
Long-running agent sessions with many skill executions may experience memory leaks or resource exhaustion if skills don't properly clean up after themselves. This could lead to degraded performance or crashes.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict resource limits per skill (memory, CPU, file handles)
2. **Automatic Cleanup:** Implement automatic cleanup of orphaned resources after skill execution
3. **Leak Detection:** Run memory leak detection tools in development and CI
4. **Monitoring:** Track memory usage over time with alerting on unusual growth
5. **Lifecycle Hooks:** Provide and enforce cleanup lifecycle hooks (onUnload, onDeactivate)
6. **Testing:** Long-running stress tests executing skills thousands of times
7. **Circuit Breakers:** Automatically disable skills that repeatedly fail cleanup

**Contingency Plan:**
If resource exhaustion is detected in production, implement emergency restart mechanism that gracefully unloads all skills and reloads only essential ones. Add periodic garbage collection triggers as temporary workaround while investigating root cause.
