# M03: Token Optimization

**Duration:** 6 weeks (120 hours)
**Phase:** Beta
**Timeline:** Weeks 9-14
**Dependencies:** M02 (Skill Infrastructure)
**Blocks:** M05 (Analytics & Compression)
**Lead Agent:** performance-engineer
**Support Agents:** ai-engineer, python-pro, backend-developer

## Overview

Implement comprehensive token optimization through dynamic budget allocation and context compression techniques, achieving 40-60% reduction in token consumption while maintaining semantic accuracy and user experience quality.

## Why This Milestone

Token consumption is the primary cost driver and performance bottleneck in Claude Code interactions. Current architecture loads full agent contexts regardless of actual task requirements, resulting in:
- Excessive baseline context (21K+ tokens with Phase 1 optimizations)
- Redundant information across multi-turn conversations
- Suboptimal resource allocation (simple tasks consume same tokens as complex ones)

This milestone delivers intelligent token management that adapts to conversation context, task complexity, and agent requirements - enabling longer conversations, more complex workflows, and reduced operational costs.

## Requirements

**FR-3.1: Dynamic Token Budget Allocation**
System shall allocate token budgets dynamically based on task complexity, agent requirements, and available context, optimizing resource utilization across multi-agent workflows.

**FR-3.2: Context Diff Compression**
System shall transmit only context deltas between conversation turns, eliminating redundant agent reloads and preserving computational efficiency.

**FR-3.3: Multi-Strategy Compression**
System shall apply temporal, structural, and semantic compression techniques preserving 100% of critical information while reducing token consumption by 40-60%.

**FR-3.4: Lazy Loading with Pre-loading**
System shall load agent context on-demand with intelligent pre-loading based on conversation patterns and predicted needs.

### Technical Requirements (TR)

**TR-3.1: Compression Validation**
Implement automated validation ensuring compressed content maintains semantic equivalence to original (>95% similarity score).

**TR-3.2: Budget Optimization Algorithm**
Develop constraint satisfaction algorithm allocating tokens across agents while respecting task requirements and quality thresholds.

Generate context diffs in <50ms for typical multi-turn conversations (<10K tokens delta).

**TR-3.4: Cache Management**
Implement LRU cache with TTL for compressed content, context diffs, and budget allocations.

### Integration Requirements (IR)

**IR-3.1: Phase 1/2 Integration**
Extend existing lazy loading (Phase 1) and analytics (Phase 2) infrastructure without breaking changes.

**IR-3.2: M02 Skills Integration**
Leverage skill infrastructure for modular compression strategies and budget policies.

**IR-3.3: Backward Compatibility**
