# M04: Orchestration Meta-Skill

**Duration:** 6 weeks (80 hours) **Phase:** Beta Feedback **Timeline:** Weeks 13-18 **Dependencies:** M01
(Coordination), M02 (Skills) **Blocks:** None (Final skill implementation) **Lead Agent:** multi-agent-coordinator
**Support Agents:** ai-engineer, workflow-orchestrator, backend-developer

## Overview

Deliver S6: Orchestration Meta-Skill - an intelligent workflow planning and execution system that reduces 80% of manual
multi-agent coordination overhead through automated task decomposition, dependency resolution, agent selection, and
failure recovery.

## Why This Milestone

Multi-agent workflows currently require explicit coordination logic, manual agent selection, and verbose handoff
protocols. The Orchestration Meta-Skill transforms Claude Code into an autonomous workflow manager that:

- Decomposes complex requests into executable task graphs
- Selects optimal agents based on capabilities and availability
- Manages dependencies, parallelization, and resource allocation
- Handles failures with automatic retry, fallback, and recovery strategies

This is the "killer app" for the Skills System - making multi-agent collaboration feel seamless and intelligent rather
than mechanical and fragile.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements (FR)

**FR-4.1: Task Decomposition** Decompose complex user requests into structured task graphs with dependencies, ordering
constraints, and resource requirements.

**FR-4.2: Agent Selection** Automatically select optimal agents for each task based on capability matching, workload,
and historical performance.

**FR-4.3: Workflow Execution** Execute task graphs with dependency management, parallel execution where possible, and
progress tracking.

**FR-4.4: Failure Recovery** Detect failures, apply recovery strategies (retry, fallback, compensation), and maintain
workflow consistency.

### Technical Requirements (TR)

**TR-4.1: DAG Generation** Generate directed acyclic graphs representing workflow structure with validation for cycles
and unreachable nodes.

**TR-4.2: Parallelization** Identify independent tasks and execute in parallel where dependency graph allows, maximizing
throughput.

**TR-4.3: State Management** Track workflow state, task status, intermediate results, and recovery points for failure
handling.

**TR-4.4: Performance**

- Task decomposition: \<500ms for typical requests
- Agent selection: \<200ms per task
- Workflow startup: \<1s for 5-task workflows
- Overhead: \<10% vs manual coordination

### Integration Requirements (IR)

**IR-4.1: M01 Coordination Integration** Leverage M01 agent discovery and coordination infrastructure as foundation.

**IR-4.2: M02 Skills Integration** Implement orchestration as a skill following M02 skill format and loading
conventions.

**IR-4.3: M03 Budget Integration** Coordinate with M03 token budget optimizer for resource-aware task allocation.

### Compliance Requirements (CR)

**CR-4.1: Explainability** Provide clear explanations for all orchestration decisions (task decomposition, agent
selection, execution order).

**CR-4.2: User Control** Enable manual overrides, execution pauses, and workflow modification during execution.

**CR-4.3: Quality Assurance** Ensure orchestrated workflows produce equivalent or better results than manual
coordination.

zero-manual-coordination workflow execution

### Part 1: Manual Coordination (Baseline) - 3 minutes

```
# Without orchestration
User: "Perform comprehensive code review of auth module"

# Manual steps required:
# 1. User: "Discover agents for code review"
# 2. System: Shows python-pro, security-expert, performance-optimizer
# 3. User: "Have python-pro analyze code style"
# 4. [Wait for completion]
# 5. User: "Hand off to security-expert for security review"
# 6. [Wait for completion]
# 7. User: "Have performance-optimizer check performance"
# 8. [Wait for completion]

# Total: 6-8 minutes, 5 manual coordination steps
```

### Part 2: Orchestrated Workflow - 4 minutes

```
# With orchestration meta-skill
User: "Perform comprehensive code review of auth module"

# System automatically:

# [Workflow Complete]
# - Duration: 42s (vs 6-8min manual)
# - Agents: 3 coordinated automatically
# - Results: Aggregated comprehensive review
```

### Part 3: Failure Recovery Demo - 3 minutes

```
# Simulate failure
# [During execution, security-expert becomes unavailable]

# System automatically:
# [Failure Detected]
# - Task 2 failed: security-expert timeout (30s)
# - Recovery strategy: Retry with fallback

# [Retry #1]
# - Retrying security-expert... Failed (still unavailable)

# [Fallback]
# - Selecting fallback agent: code-reviewer (security capability: 0.75)
# - Executing with code-reviewer... Success
