______________________________________________________________________

## Next Steps After Your Review

### If Approved (Ready to Proceed)

1. **Start new Claude Code session** with Linear MCP server configured
1. **Create Linear project** "Claude Code Skills" (if not exists)
1. **Create Linear milestones** for MLP, Dogfooding, Beta, Beta Feedback, GA
1. **Convert milestone tasks to Linear issues:**
   - Each Task (1.1, 1.2, etc.) becomes a Linear issue
   - Acceptance criteria → issue description checklist
   - Effort estimates → time tracking
   - Dependencies → Linear blocking relationships
   - Agents → assignees (or labels)
1. **Begin M01 implementation** (Week 1 kicks off)

### If Revisions Needed

**Common Areas to Refine:**

- Effort estimates (too optimistic? too conservative?)
- Task breakdowns (too granular? not enough detail?)
- Demo scenarios (want different validation approaches?)
- Success metrics (different targets? additional metrics?)
- Risk mitigation (need more contingencies?)
- Agent assignments (prefer different specialists?)

**How to Provide Feedback:**

- Comment on specific milestones (M01, M02, etc.)
- Call out specific tasks or acceptance criteria
- Suggest timeline adjustments
- Identify missing requirements or risks
- Request clarification on technical approaches

______________________________________________________________________

## Questions for You

Before proceeding to Linear issue creation, please confirm:

1. **Milestone Scope:** Do M01-M05 cover the right features in the right order?

1. **Timeline:** Does 24 weeks (6 months) feel realistic for 520 hours of work?

1. **Demo Scenarios:** Are the demo scenarios the right way to validate each milestone?

1. **Success Metrics:** Are the metrics in `success-metrics.md` the right ones to track?

1. **Linear Mapping:** Does the MLP → Dogfooding → Beta → Beta Feedback → GA mapping make sense for your workflow?

1. **Technical Approach:** Any concerns about the architecture or implementation strategies?

1. **Resources:** Do you have the team capacity (2-3 developers, 20-30h/week)?

1. **Dependencies:** Any external dependencies or blockers we haven't accounted for?
