# Claude Code Skills

**Status:** Planning → MLP **Owner:** Gerald Sornsen **Timeline:** Q1 2025 - Q2 2025 (6 months) **Strategic Priority:**
High - Foundation for agent capabilities

## Executive Summary

Claude Code Skills transforms Mycelium agents from static knowledge repositories into dynamic, capability-driven
assistants. By implementing a modular skills framework, agents gain composable capabilities through skill modules,
dynamic skill loading, and intelligent coordination—enabling them to handle complex, multi-step tasks with reduced token
consumption and improved performance.

This project addresses three critical challenges in the current agent system:

1. **Coordination inefficiency** - Agents duplicate knowledge and struggle with handoffs
1. **Token waste** - Large context windows filled with unused specialist knowledge
1. **Limited extensibility** - Adding capabilities requires modifying core agent descriptions

### Key Outcomes

- **40-60% token reduction** through dynamic skill loading and compression
- **Composable capabilities** via reusable skill modules
- **Intelligent coordination** through agent discovery and skill matching
- **Enhanced extensibility** with hot-reloadable skills and gradual rollout
- **Measurable impact** via analytics on skill usage and performance

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

1. **Enable Agent Discovery** - Agents can find and coordinate with specialists based on capabilities
1. **Implement Dynamic Skills** - Load only required capabilities at runtime
1. **Optimize Token Usage** - Reduce context consumption by 40-60% through compression and lazy loading
1. **Create Orchestration** - Meta-skill for managing complex multi-agent workflows
1. **Measure Impact** - Track skill usage, performance, and optimization effectiveness

### Success Metrics

- **Token Efficiency:** 40-60% reduction in average context consumption
- **Discovery Success:** >90% accuracy in matching tasks to appropriate agents
- **Coordination Quality:** \<2 agent handoffs for typical multi-step tasks
- **Skill Reuse:** 60%+ of skills used across multiple agents
- **Performance:** \<200ms overhead for skill loading and discovery

## Architecture Overview

The skills framework introduces three core components:

### 1. Skill Modules

Reusable capability units that agents load dynamically:

- **Format:** JSON-based with metadata, dependencies, and content
- **Categories:** Technical (code, debug), Communication (customer support), Analysis (data, trends)
- **Lifecycle:** Hot-reloadable without agent restarts
- **Storage:** Centralized repository with version control

### 2. Discovery System

Capability-based agent matching:

- **Directory:** Real-time agent registry with skill inventories
- **Matching:** NLP-based task decomposition and skill mapping
- **Context:** Conversational state sharing for seamless handoffs
- **Routing:** Intelligent selection based on workload and specialization

### 3. Compression Engine

Token optimization through multiple strategies:

- **Temporal:** Remove time-sensitive content older than 90 days
- **Structural:** Deduplicate common patterns and merge similar sections
- **Semantic:** Preserve meaning while reducing verbosity
- **Dynamic:** Load compressed base + full skills on-demand
