IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
-------------------------
[ ] Review this analysis with stakeholders
[ ] Select compression strategy (Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive)
[ ] Create automated compression script
[ ] Run pilot test on 10 representative agents
[ ] Validate agent selection still works correctly
[ ] Measure actual vs. estimated savings
[ ] Apply Phase 1 changes to all 119 agents
[ ] Review and manual cleanup
[ ] Apply Phase 2 changes (if using Balanced/Aggressive)
[ ] Final validation and testing
[ ] Update style guide for future agent additions
[ ] Monitor metrics post-deployment

RISK MITIGATION
----------------
✓ Maintain original descriptions in version control
✓ Incremental rollout (10-20 agents at a time)
✓ Automated testing for agent selection functionality
✓ Preserve all essential keywords for discoverability
✓ Manual review of edge cases
✓ Stakeholder approval before batch processing

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Review full report: AGENT_DESCRIPTION_COMPRESSION_REPORT.md
2. Review detailed analysis: agent_analysis_results.json
3. Decide on compression approach
4. Schedule implementation time
5. Begin with pilot test
