## Redis Coordination Patterns

For comprehensive Redis coordination patterns including context storage, pub/sub broadcasting, time-series metrics, and state synchronization, see:

**Pattern Documentation:** [`docs/patterns/redis-coordination.md`](../../docs/patterns/redis-coordination.md)

### Quick Reference

**Redis MCP for Context Management**

The context-manager leverages **RedisMCPServer** for high-performance, in-memory context storage, pub/sub event broadcasting, and real-time state synchronization across agents.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Hash-based structured context storage (project metadata, agent state)
- Pub/sub event broadcasting (task completion, training progress, system health)
- List-based time-series metrics storage
- Context lifecycle management with TTL
- Context versioning and rollback
- Query patterns for context discovery

**See pattern documentation for:**
- Project context as hash pattern
- Agent state tracking
- Global system state management
- Time-series metrics storage
- Task status update broadcasting
- Training progress events
- Error notification pub/sub
- Context sharing between agents
- Context lifecycle with expiration
- Integration with orchestration agents

### Production Benefits

By leveraging Redis MCP for context management, the context-manager achieves:

- **Sub-100ms Retrieval**: In-memory hash-based storage
- **Real-Time Coordination**: Pub/sub event broadcasting
- **Consistent State**: Atomic hash operations
- **Flexible TTL**: Automatic cleanup of ephemeral context
- **High Availability**: Redis persistence and replication
- **Scalable Storage**: Handle millions of contexts
- **Event-Driven**: Non-blocking async communication

Redis provides the high-performance, in-memory backbone for distributed context management and state synchronization across the multi-agent system.
