## Temporal MCP for Durable Workflow Management

The workflow-orchestrator agent uses the **temporal-mcp MCP server** for durable, fault-tolerant workflow execution with automatic state persistence, retry handling, and long-running process management.

### Why Temporal for ML Training Workflows?

Machine learning training pipelines are inherently long-running, resource-intensive, and failure-prone:

- **Hours-to-Days Duration**: Voice cloning training runs for 6-48 hours on RTX 4090
- **Checkpoint Management**: Must save/resume from GPU memory state without data loss
- **Multi-Stage Pipelines**: Data prep → training → evaluation → deployment requires coordination
- **Infrastructure Failures**: GPU crashes, OOM errors, network interruptions need graceful recovery
- **Human-in-Loop**: Manual approval gates for model quality before deployment
- **Cost Management**: Efficient resource utilization across expensive GPU time

Temporal provides **durable execution** guarantees that make ML workflows resilient:

1. **Automatic State Persistence**: Workflow state saved after every activity
2. **Transparent Retries**: Failed activities retry with exponential backoff
3. **Workflow History**: Complete audit trail of every execution step
4. **Long-Running Support**: Workflows can run for months without worker restarts
5. **Versioning**: Deploy new workflow logic without breaking in-flight executions

### Available Temporal MCP Tools

The temporal-mcp MCP server provides these capabilities:

- `mcp__temporal-mcp__GetWorkflowHistory` - Retrieve complete execution history for a workflow run
- Temporal CLI integration - Execute workflows, query status, cancel/terminate runs
- Workflow queries - Real-time state inspection without interrupting execution
- Activity retries - Automatic retry with configurable policies
- Signals - Send external events to running workflows
- Child workflows - Hierarchical workflow composition

### Workflow Architecture for Voice Cloning Pipeline

#### Core Training Workflow Pattern

### Activity Implementation with Checkpoint Recovery

```python
# Activities are the units of work that can fail and retry
# File: podcast_pipeline/workflows/training_activities.py

from temporalio import activity
import torch
from pathlib import Path

@activity.defn
async def train_model_with_checkpoints(
    model_handle: ModelHandle,
    dataset: Dataset,
    hyperparameters: Hyperparameters
) -> TrainingResult:
    """
    Training activity with checkpoint/resume support.

    Temporal guarantees:
    - Activity can be interrupted at any time (worker crash, deployment)
    - On retry, resumes from last saved checkpoint
    - Heartbeat signals activity is alive (must call every <5min)
    """
    checkpoint_dir = Path(f"checkpoints/{activity.info().workflow_id}")
    checkpoint_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

    # Check for existing checkpoint (resume after retry)
    last_checkpoint = find_latest_checkpoint(checkpoint_dir)
    if last_checkpoint:
        logger.info("resuming_from_checkpoint",
                   checkpoint=last_checkpoint.path,
                   step=last_checkpoint.step)
        model, optimizer, scheduler, start_step = load_checkpoint(last_checkpoint)
    else:
        logger.info("starting_training_from_scratch")
        model, optimizer, scheduler = initialize_training(model_handle, hyperparameters)
        start_step = 0

    # Training loop with heartbeat
    for step in range(start_step, hyperparameters.total_steps):
        batch = dataset.get_batch(step)

        # Forward/backward pass
        loss = training_step(model, batch, optimizer, scheduler)

        # Heartbeat every 100 steps (signals activity is alive)
        if step % 100 == 0:
            activity.heartbeat({"step": step, "loss": loss})

        # Save checkpoint every 500 steps
        if step % 500 == 0:
            checkpoint_path = checkpoint_dir / f"step_{step}.pt"
            save_checkpoint(model, optimizer, scheduler, step, checkpoint_path)
            logger.info("checkpoint_saved", step=step, path=checkpoint_path)

        # Publish training metrics to Redis for real-time monitoring

        model_path=str(final_model_path),
        final_loss=loss,
        total_steps=hyperparameters.total_steps
    )
```

### Querying Workflow Execution History

Use `mcp__temporal-mcp__GetWorkflowHistory` to retrieve complete execution details:

```javascript
// Query workflow history via Temporal MCP
const history = await mcp__temporal_mcp__GetWorkflowHistory({
  workflowId: "voice-clone-training-proj-1",
  runId: "optional-specific-run-id"  // Omit for latest run
});

// History contains every event in workflow execution:
// - WorkflowExecutionStarted
// - ActivityTaskScheduled (for each activity)
// - ActivityTaskStarted
// - ActivityTaskCompleted (or Failed/TimedOut)
// - WorkflowSignalReceived (for approval signals)
// - WorkflowExecutionCompleted

// Example: Extract training progress from activity heartbeats
const trainingHeartbeats = history.events
  .filter(e => e.eventType === "ActivityTaskHeartbeatRecorded")
  .map(e => JSON.parse(e.details));

console.log("Training progress:");
trainingHeartbeats.forEach(hb => {
  console.log(`  Step ${hb.step}: loss = ${hb.loss}`);
});

// Check if workflow is still running
const finalEvent = history.events[history.events.length - 1];
const isComplete = finalEvent.eventType === "WorkflowExecutionCompleted";
const isFailed = finalEvent.eventType === "WorkflowExecutionFailed";
```

### Pattern 1: Multi-Stage ML Pipeline with Child Workflows

For complex pipelines, use parent workflow to orchestrate multiple child workflows:

```python
@workflow.defn
class PodcastSynthesisPipelineWorkflow:
    """
    Parent workflow orchestrating multi-speaker podcast generation.

    Child workflows:
    1. VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow (per speaker)
    2. ScriptProcessingWorkflow (dialogue parsing)
    3. AudioSynthesisWorkflow (multi-speaker generation)
    4. MixingWorkflow (final episode assembly)
    """

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, podcast_config: PodcastConfig) -> PodcastEpisode:
        # Train each speaker model (parallel child workflows)
        training_tasks = []
        for speaker in podcast_config.speakers:
            child_workflow = workflow.start_child_workflow(
                VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow.run,
                args=[speaker.training_config],
                id=f"train-{speaker.name}",
                execution_timeout=timedelta(hours=48)
            )
            training_tasks.append(child_workflow)

        # Wait for all training to complete
        speaker_models = await asyncio.gather(*training_tasks)

        logger.info("all_speakers_trained",
                   num_speakers=len(speaker_models))

        # Process script (sequential child workflow)
        dialogue = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
            ScriptProcessingWorkflow.run,
            args=[podcast_config.script_path],
            id=f"script-{podcast_config.episode_id}"
        )

        # Synthesize audio (child workflow with speaker models)
        audio_segments = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
            AudioSynthesisWorkflow.run,
            args=[dialogue, speaker_models],
            id=f"synthesis-{podcast_config.episode_id}"
        )

        # Mix final episode (child workflow)
        final_episode = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
            MixingWorkflow.run,
            args=[audio_segments, podcast_config.mixing_config],
            id=f"mixing-{podcast_config.episode_id}"
        )

        return final_episode
```

### Pattern 2: Saga Pattern for Distributed Training

Use Temporal's compensation logic for multi-GPU distributed training:

```python
@workflow.defn
class DistributedTrainingWorkflow:
    """
    Saga pattern for distributed training across multiple GPUs.

    If any GPU fails, compensate by:
    1. Releasing all GPU reservations
    2. Saving checkpoint from healthy nodes
    3. Retrying with fewer GPUs or different hardware
    """

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, training_config: DistributedTrainingConfig):
        reserved_gpus = []

        try:
            # Reserve GPU resources (compensatable)
            for gpu_id in training_config.gpu_ids:
                gpu = await workflow.execute_activity(
                    reserve_gpu,
                    args=[gpu_id],
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
                )
                reserved_gpus.append(gpu)

            # Initialize distributed training (compensatable)
            dist_handle = await workflow.execute_activity(
                initialize_distributed_training,
                args=[reserved_gpus, training_config],
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)
            )

            # Execute training (main saga transaction)
            result = await workflow.execute_activity(
                run_distributed_training,
                args=[dist_handle],
                start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(hours=48),
                heartbeat_timeout=timedelta(minutes=5)
            )

            return result

        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("distributed_training_failed", error=str(e))

            # Compensation: Release all reserved GPUs
            for gpu in reserved_gpus:
                await workflow.execute_activity(
                    release_gpu,
                    args=[gpu],
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=2)
                )

            # Compensation: Save checkpoint from any healthy nodes
            if dist_handle:
                await workflow.execute_activity(
                    emergency_checkpoint_save,
                    args=[dist_handle],
                    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(minutes=10)
                )

            raise  # Re-raise to mark workflow as failed
```

### Pattern 3: Timer-Based Training Schedules

Schedule training runs during off-peak hours for cost optimization:

```python
@workflow.defn
class ScheduledTrainingWorkflow:
    """
    Schedule training during off-peak GPU hours (2am-6am).

    Uses Temporal timers to wait until optimal time window.
    """

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, training_config: TrainingConfig):
        # Calculate next off-peak window
        next_window = calculate_next_off_peak_window()
        now = workflow.now()

        if next_window > now:
            wait_duration = next_window - now
            logger.info("waiting_for_off_peak_window",
                       wait_hours=wait_duration.total_seconds() / 3600)

            # Temporal timer - workflow sleeps but uses no resources
            await asyncio.sleep(wait_duration.total_seconds())

        # Execute training during off-peak window
        result = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
            VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow.run,
            args=[training_config]
        )

        return result
```

### Pattern 4: Continue-As-New for Iterative Training

For very long-running workflows (hyperparameter sweeps), use continue-as-new to prevent history bloat:

```python
@workflow.defn
class HyperparameterSweepWorkflow:
    """
    Iterative hyperparameter tuning with continue-as-new.

    Temporal workflows have ~50KB history limit. For 100+ training runs,
    use continue-as-new to start fresh workflow with accumulated results.
    """

    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, sweep_config: SweepConfig, results: List[Result] = None):
        results = results or []

        # Train with current hyperparameters
        current_result = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
            VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow.run,
            args=[sweep_config.current_params]
        )
        results.append(current_result)

        # Check if sweep complete
        if sweep_config.is_complete(results):
            best_result = find_best_result(results)
            return best_result

        # Continue as new workflow with updated state
        next_config = sweep_config.next_iteration(results)
        workflow.continue_as_new(next_config, results)
```

### Querying Workflow Status from Orchestrator

The workflow-orchestrator can query Temporal workflows to coordinate task distribution:

```javascript
// Check if training workflow is still running
async function isTrainingWorkflowRunning(projectId) {
  try {
    const history = await mcp__temporal-mcp__GetWorkflowHistory({
      workflowId: `voice-clone-training-${projectId}`
    });

    const lastEvent = history.events[history.events.length - 1];
    const runningStates = [
      "WorkflowExecutionStarted",
      "ActivityTaskScheduled",
      "ActivityTaskStarted"
    ];

    return runningStates.includes(lastEvent.eventType);

  } catch (error) {
    // Workflow doesn't exist or failed to query
    return false;
  }
}

// Query training progress via activity heartbeats
async function getTrainingProgress(projectId) {
  const history = await mcp__temporal-mcp__GetWorkflowHistory({
    workflowId: `voice-clone-training-${projectId}`
  });

  // Extract latest heartbeat data
  const heartbeats = history.events
    .filter(e => e.eventType === "ActivityTaskHeartbeatRecorded")
    .map(e => JSON.parse(e.details));

  if (heartbeats.length === 0) {
    return { status: "starting", step: 0 };
  }

  const latest = heartbeats[heartbeats.length - 1];
  return {
    status: "training",
    step: latest.step,
    loss: latest.loss,
    progress_pct: (latest.step / latest.total_steps) * 100
  };
}
```

### Integration with Task-Distributor

workflow-orchestrator coordinates with task-distributor to spawn specialist agents for workflow activities:

```javascript
// When Temporal activity needs agent execution
async function executeActivityWithAgent(activityName, activityArgs) {
  // Get next available agent from task-distributor
  const agent = await queryTaskDistributor({
    activityType: activityName,
    requiredCapabilities: inferCapabilities(activityName)
  });

  // Spawn specialist agent via Claude Code Task tool
  const result = await Task({
    subagent_type: agent.type,  // e.g., "data-engineer", "ai-engineer"
    description: activityName,
    prompt: `
      Execute Temporal activity: ${activityName}

      Args: ${JSON.stringify(activityArgs)}

      This activity is part of workflow: ${workflow.info().workflow_id}

      Activity requirements:
      - Must complete within ${activityTimeout} minutes
      - Must heartbeat every ${heartbeatTimeout} seconds
      - Can be interrupted and resumed (checkpoint if long-running)

      Please execute this activity and return structured result.
    `
  });

  return result;
}
```

### Integration with Context-Manager

Workflow state can be synchronized with Redis via context-manager:

```python
# In workflow activities, publish state updates
@activity.defn
async def training_activity(model, dataset):
    for step in training_loop():
        # ... training logic ...

        # Publish workflow state to Redis for dashboard
        await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
            name: f"workflows:{workflow_id}:state",
            key: "current_step",
            value: step,
            expire_seconds: 604800  # 7 days
        })

        await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
            name: f"workflows:{workflow_id}:state",
            key: "status",
            value: "training"
        })
```

### Integration with Performance-Monitor

Workflow metrics can be tracked in Redis for real-time monitoring:

```python
# Publish workflow execution metrics
@activity.defn
async def track_workflow_metrics():
    workflow_info = activity.info().workflow_info

    # Track workflow execution time
    await mcp__RedisMCPServer__lpush({
        name: "metrics:workflows:execution_time",
        value: JSON.stringify({
            workflow_id: workflow_info.workflow_id,
            workflow_type: workflow_info.workflow_type,
            duration_seconds: workflow_info.execution_time.total_seconds(),
            timestamp: workflow_info.start_time
        })
    })

    # Track workflow success/failure rates
    await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
        name: "metrics:workflows:completion_rates",
        key: workflow_info.workflow_type,
        value: await calculate_success_rate(workflow_info.workflow_type)
    })
```

### Integration with Error-Coordinator

Failed workflow activities trigger error tracking:

```python
# In activity error handler
@activity.defn
async def training_activity_with_error_tracking():
    try:
        result = await train_model()
        return result
    except Exception as error:
        # Publish to error coordinator
        await mcp__RedisMCPServer__publish({
            channel: "events:errors:workflow_failures",
            message: JSON.stringify({
                workflow_id: activity.info().workflow_id,
                activity_name: activity.info().activity_type,
                error_type: error.__class__.__name__,
                error_message: str(error),
                attempt: activity.info().attempt,
                timestamp: datetime.now().isoformat()
            })
        })

        # Check circuit breaker before retry
        circuit_breaker_status = await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hget({
            name: f"circuit_breakers:activity:{activity.info().activity_type}",
            key: "state"
        })

        if circuit_breaker_status === "open":
            raise ActivityCancelledException(
                "Circuit breaker open for this activity type"
            )

        # Let Temporal retry with configured policy
        raise
```

### Workflow Monitoring Dashboard Data

Aggregate workflow metrics for real-time dashboard:

```javascript
// Query workflow execution statistics
async function getWorkflowDashboardMetrics() {
  // Active workflows count
  const activeWorkflows = await countActiveWorkflows();

  // Recent workflow history (last 100 executions)
  const recentExecutions = await mcp__RedisMCPServer__lrange({
    name: "metrics:workflows:execution_time",
    start: 0,
    stop: 99
  });

  const executions = recentExecutions.map(e => JSON.parse(e));

  // Calculate statistics
  const avgDuration = executions.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.duration_seconds, 0) / executions.length;
  const successRate = executions.filter(e => e.status === "completed").length / executions.length;

  // Workflow types breakdown
  const workflowTypes = executions.reduce((acc, e) => {
    acc[e.workflow_type] = (acc[e.workflow_type] || 0) + 1;
    return acc;
  }, {});

  return {
    active_workflows: activeWorkflows,
    avg_duration_minutes: avgDuration / 60,
    success_rate_pct: successRate * 100,
    workflow_types: workflowTypes,
    total_executions_24h: executions.length
  };
}
```

### Workflow Versioning Strategy

Deploy new workflow versions without breaking in-flight executions:

```python
# Version 1: Initial training workflow
@workflow.defn(name="VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow")
class VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow_V1:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, config):
        # Original implementation
        pass

# Version 2: Add evaluation stage
@workflow.defn(name="VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow")
class VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow_V2:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, config):
        # Enhanced implementation with evaluation

        # Use workflow.get_version() for backward compatibility
        version = workflow.get_version("add_evaluation",
                                       min_supported=1,
                                       max_supported=2)

        if version == 1:
            # Old path: no evaluation
            result = await train_only(config)
        else:
            # New path: with evaluation
            result = await train_with_evaluation(config)

        return result
```

### Temporal CLI Integration

workflow-orchestrator can use Temporal CLI via bash commands:

```javascript
// Start a new workflow execution
await Bash({
  command: `temporal workflow start \\
    --workflow-id voice-clone-training-proj-1 \\
    --type VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow \\
    --namespace default \\
    --task-queue ml-training-queue \\
    --input '${JSON.stringify(trainingConfig)}'`,
  description: "Start voice cloning training workflow"
});

// Query workflow status
const statusResult = await Bash({
  command: `temporal workflow show \\
    --workflow-id voice-clone-training-proj-1 \\
    --namespace default`,
  description: "Query training workflow status"
});

// Send approval signal to workflow
await Bash({
  command: `temporal workflow signal \\
    --workflow-id voice-clone-training-proj-1 \\
    --name approve_model \\
    --input '{"approved": true, "reviewer": "human-reviewer"}'`,
  description: "Approve trained model"
});

// Cancel long-running workflow
await Bash({
  command: `temporal workflow cancel \\
    --workflow-id voice-clone-training-proj-1 \\
    --reason "Training taking too long, canceling to try different hyperparameters"`,
  description: "Cancel training workflow"
});
```

### Workflow Testing Strategy

Test workflows using Temporal's test environment:

```python
# File: tests/workflows/test_training_workflow.py

from temporalio.testing import WorkflowEnvironment
from temporalio.worker import Worker
import pytest

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_voice_clone_training_workflow():
    """Test complete training workflow execution."""
    async with await WorkflowEnvironment.start_local() as env:
        # Register workflow and activities
        worker = Worker(
            env.client,
            task_queue="test-queue",
            workflows=[VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow],
            activities=[
                prepare_training_dataset,
                initialize_model,
                train_model_with_checkpoints,
                evaluate_model,
                deploy_model
            ]
        )

        async with worker:
            # Execute workflow
            result = await env.client.execute_workflow(
                VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow.run,
                args=[test_training_config],
                id="test-training-workflow",
                task_queue="test-queue"
            )

            # Verify results
            assert result.model_path.exists()
            assert result.metrics.wer < 0.07  # WER < 7%
            assert result.metrics.cer < 0.03  # CER < 3%

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_training_workflow_recovery_after_failure():
    """Test workflow resumes from checkpoint after activity failure."""
    async with await WorkflowEnvironment.start_local() as env:
        # Inject failure in training activity
        worker = Worker(
            env.client,
            task_queue="test-queue",
            workflows=[VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow],
            activities=[training_activity_that_fails_once]
        )

        async with worker:
            # Workflow should retry and succeed
            result = await env.client.execute_workflow(
                VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow.run,
                args=[test_training_config],
                id="test-recovery-workflow",
                task_queue="test-queue"
            )

            # Verify checkpoint recovery worked
            assert result.resumed_from_checkpoint
            assert result.checkpoint_step > 0
```

### Workflow Best Practices

1. **Always Use Heartbeats for Long Activities**: Activities >30 seconds must heartbeat to signal liveness
2. **Design Idempotent Activities**: Activities can be retried multiple times - ensure side effects are safe
3. **Use Checkpoint/Resume for GPU Training**: Save checkpoints every 500 steps, resume on activity retry
4. **Separate Fast and Slow Activities**: Don't mix quick validation (10s) with training (hours) in same activity
5. **Use Child Workflows for Modularity**: Break complex pipelines into composable child workflows
6. **Version Workflows Carefully**: Use workflow.get_version() for backward-compatible schema changes
7. **Set Realistic Timeouts**: Training activities need hours, not minutes - set start_to_close_timeout appropriately
8. **Publish Metrics to Redis**: Enable real-time monitoring without querying Temporal history repeatedly
9. **Use Signals for Human Approval**: Workflow.wait_condition() for manual quality gates
10. **Continue-As-New for Unbounded Loops**: Prevent history bloat in hyperparameter sweeps and long experiments

### Temporal Workflow Observability

Monitor workflow health across all dimensions:

**Workflow Metrics to Track:**
- Active workflow count by type
- Workflow execution duration (P50, P95, P99)
- Activity retry rates by activity type
- Workflow success/failure rates
- Checkpoint save/load latency
- Heartbeat health (missed heartbeats indicate stuck activities)
- Signal processing latency (time from signal to workflow reaction)

**Query workflow health via Redis:**

```javascript
// Track workflow execution rates
await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
  name: "metrics:workflows:throughput",
  key: "workflows_started_last_hour",
  value: await countWorkflowsStartedSince(Date.now() - 3600000)
});

// Track activity retry rates (high retries = infrastructure problems)
await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
  name: "metrics:workflows:activity_retries",
  key: "train_model_with_checkpoints",
  value: await countActivityRetries("train_model_with_checkpoints", "last_24h")
});
```

### Handling Workflow Failures and Recovery

**Failure Scenarios:**

1. **Activity Timeout**: Activity exceeded start_to_close_timeout
   - **Recovery**: Temporal retries automatically with exponential backoff
   - **Action**: Check activity logs for root cause, adjust timeout if needed

2. **Activity Failure**: Activity threw exception (OOM, GPU error, bad data)
   - **Recovery**: Retry from last checkpoint (if implemented)
   - **Action**: Publish error to error-coordinator, check circuit breaker

3. **Workflow Timeout**: Entire workflow exceeded execution timeout
   - **Recovery**: Manual investigation required
   - **Action**: Cancel workflow, save emergency checkpoint, restart with adjusted config

4. **Worker Crash**: Temporal worker process died
   - **Recovery**: Workflow automatically continues when worker restarts
   - **Action**: No action needed - Temporal guarantees at-least-once execution

5. **Heartbeat Timeout**: Activity stopped heartbeating (stuck/crashed)
   - **Recovery**: Temporal marks activity as failed, triggers retry
   - **Action**: Investigate worker logs, check GPU health

**Emergency Recovery Commands:**

```javascript
// Emergency checkpoint save before canceling workflow
await Bash({
  command: `temporal workflow signal \\
    --workflow-id ${workflowId} \\
    --name emergency_checkpoint \\
    --input '{\"reason\": \"Manual intervention required\"}'`,
  description: "Trigger emergency checkpoint"
});

// Wait for checkpoint signal to process
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 30000));

// Cancel workflow gracefully
await Bash({
  command: `temporal workflow cancel --workflow-id ${workflowId}`,
  description: "Cancel workflow after emergency checkpoint"
});
```

### Cost Optimization with Temporal

**GPU Time Optimization:**

```python
# Calculate GPU cost per workflow execution
@workflow.defn
class CostAwareTrainingWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, config):
        start_time = workflow.now()

        result = await workflow.execute_child_workflow(
            VoiceCloneTrainingWorkflow.run,
            args=[config]
        )

        end_time = workflow.now()
        duration_hours = (end_time - start_time).total_seconds() / 3600

        # RTX 4090 cost: ~$1.50/hour
        gpu_cost = duration_hours * 1.50

        # Store cost metrics
        await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
            name: f"costs:training:{config.project_id}",
            key: "gpu_cost_usd",
            value: gpu_cost
        })

        return TrainingResultWithCost(
            model_path=result.model_path,
            metrics=result.metrics,
            cost_usd=gpu_cost,
            duration_hours=duration_hours
        )
```

By integrating Temporal workflows with Redis metrics, taskqueue coordination, and error tracking, the workflow-orchestrator achieves:

- **99.9%+ Workflow Reliability**: Automatic retry and checkpoint recovery
- **Sub-30s Recovery Time**: Resume from last checkpoint after failures
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Every workflow step logged in Temporal history
- **Cost Visibility**: Track GPU spend per training run
- **Human-in-Loop Support**: Approval gates for quality validation
- **Scalable Orchestration**: Handle 100+ concurrent training workflows

Temporal provides the durable execution backbone that makes long-running ML training workflows production-ready.
