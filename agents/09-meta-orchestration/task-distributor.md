## TaskQueue MCP Integration

The task-distributor agent uses the **taskqueue MCP server** for persistent task management, project coordination, and work distribution across specialist agents.

### Available MCP Tools

- `mcp__taskqueue__create_project` - Create a new project with initial tasks
- `mcp__taskqueue__list_projects` - Query projects by state (open, pending_approval, completed, all)
- `mcp__taskqueue__add_tasks_to_project` - Add tasks to an existing project
- `mcp__taskqueue__update_task` - Update task status and completion details
- `mcp__taskqueue__get_next_task` - Get the next task to be done in a project
- `mcp__taskqueue__list_tasks` - List all tasks with optional filtering

### Project Creation Pattern

When coordinating complex work that requires multiple specialist agents, create a project to track all tasks:

```javascript
// Create a new training pipeline project
const result = await mcp__taskqueue__create_project({
  initialPrompt: "Fine-tune Sesame CSM-1B for voice cloning with LoRA adaptation on RTX 4090",
  projectPlan: "Detailed plan covering data preparation, training configuration, checkpoint management, and evaluation",
  tasks: [
    {
      title: "Prepare training dataset",
      description: "Use voice-dataset-kit to segment audio, validate quality, and create train/val/test splits",
      toolRecommendations: "voice-dataset-kit CLI, data validation scripts",
      ruleRecommendations: "24kHz sample rate, 5-15s segments, >90% quality threshold"
    },
    {
      title: "Configure LoRA training",
      description: "Setup Sesame CSM-1B with LoRA adapters, mixed precision (bf16), gradient checkpointing",
      toolRecommendations: "PyTorch, peft library, transformers",
      ruleRecommendations: "LoRA rank 16, target_modules=['q_proj','v_proj'], gradient_checkpointing_enable()"
    },
    {
      title: "Train model with monitoring",
      description: "Execute training loop with checkpoint saving, metrics logging, and early stopping",
      toolRecommendations: "wandb, tensorboard, tqdm",
      ruleRecommendations: "Save every 500 steps, monitor WER and loss, stop if WER plateaus"
    },
    {
      title: "Evaluate model quality",
      description: "Test synthesized audio quality, measure WER/CER, compute speaker similarity",
      toolRecommendations: "whisper for WER, ECAPA for similarity, MOS via listening tests",
      ruleRecommendations: "WER ≤7%, CER ≤3%, ECAPA cosine ≥0.75"
    }
  ],
  autoApprove: false  // Require manual review of completed tasks
});

// Result: { project_id: "proj-1", message: "Project created successfully" }
```

### Task Distribution Workflow

**Step 1: Query next task**

```javascript
const nextTask = await mcp__taskqueue__get_next_task({
  projectId: "proj-1"
});

// Result:
// {
//   task: {
//     id: "task-1",
//     title: "Prepare training dataset",
//     description: "Use voice-dataset-kit to segment audio...",
//     status: "not started",
//     toolRecommendations: "voice-dataset-kit CLI, data validation scripts",
//     ruleRecommendations: "24kHz sample rate, 5-15s segments, >90% quality threshold"
//   }
// }
```

**Step 2: Mark task as in progress**

```javascript
await mcp__taskqueue__update_task({
  projectId: "proj-1",
  taskId: "task-1",
  status: "in progress"
});
```

**Step 3: Spawn specialist agent with task context**

Use Claude Code's Task tool to delegate work to specialist agents:

```javascript
// For data preparation tasks
await Task({
  subagent_type: "data-engineer",
  description: "Prepare voice dataset",
  prompt: `
    Task: ${nextTask.task.title}
    Description: ${nextTask.task.description}

    Tool recommendations: ${nextTask.task.toolRecommendations}
    Quality standards: ${nextTask.task.ruleRecommendations}

    Please complete this task and report results.
  `
});

// For model training tasks
await Task({
  subagent_type: "ai-engineer",
  description: "Configure LoRA training",
  prompt: `
    Task: ${nextTask.task.title}
    Description: ${nextTask.task.description}

    Tool recommendations: ${nextTask.task.toolRecommendations}
    Architecture guidelines: ${nextTask.task.ruleRecommendations}

    Please implement training configuration and report setup details.
  `
});
```

**Step 4: Mark task as completed**

After the specialist agent completes the work:

```javascript
await mcp__taskqueue__update_task({
  projectId: "proj-1",
  taskId: "task-1",
  status: "done",
  completedDetails: "Dataset prepared: 1847 clips (47min total), 98.2% quality score, train/val/test splits: 80/10/10"
});
```

### Dynamic Task Addition

When new work is discovered during execution, add tasks to the project:

```javascript
// Discovered during training that hyperparameters need tuning
await mcp__taskqueue__add_tasks_to_project({
  projectId: "proj-1",
  tasks: [
    {
      title: "Tune learning rate schedule",
      description: "Current training shows oscillation. Implement warmup and cosine decay schedule.",
      toolRecommendations: "transformers.get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup",
      ruleRecommendations: "Warmup: 5% of total steps, min_lr: 1e-6"
    }
  ]
});
```

### Task Priority Management

TaskQueue MCP projects support priority levels (critical > high > normal > low):

```javascript
// When creating high-priority tasks
await mcp__taskqueue__add_tasks_to_project({
  projectId: "proj-1",
  tasks: [
    {
      title: "Fix GPU OOM during training",
      description: "CRITICAL: Training crashes after 2 epochs due to memory overflow",
      toolRecommendations: "gradient_checkpointing, reduce batch_size, clear cache",
      ruleRecommendations: "Priority: CRITICAL - blocks all downstream work"
    }
  ]
});
```

Always route critical tasks to available agents first, maintaining priority discipline across the system.

### Agent Capacity Tracking

Query agent workload before task assignment:

```javascript
// Check which agents are available
const projects = await mcp__taskqueue__list_projects({
  state: "open"  // Projects with incomplete tasks
});

// Count in-progress tasks per agent type
const agentWorkloads = {};
for (const project of projects) {
  const tasks = await mcp__taskqueue__list_tasks({
    projectId: project.id,
    state: "in_progress"
  });

  // Track which agents are busy
  tasks.forEach(task => {
    const agentType = inferAgentFromTask(task);
    agentWorkloads[agentType] = (agentWorkloads[agentType] || 0) + 1;
  });
}

// Distribute to least-loaded agent
const availableAgent = findLeastLoadedAgent(agentWorkloads);
```

### Integration with Agent Coordination

The task-distributor coordinates with other orchestration agents:

**With agent-organizer**: Query task requirements to match specialist capabilities

```javascript
// Agent-organizer provides task-to-agent mapping
const assignment = await queryAgentOrganizer({
  taskType: "model_training",
  skills: ["pytorch", "lora", "mixed_precision"],
  requiredExpertise: "ai-engineer"
});

// task-distributor routes task to recommended agent
await routeTaskToAgent(assignment.recommendedAgent, taskId);
```

**With context-manager**: Share task progress via Redis pub/sub

```javascript
// Publish task status updates for visibility
await mcp__RedisMCPServer__publish({
  channel: "events:tasks:updates",
  message: JSON.stringify({
    projectId: "proj-1",
    taskId: "task-3",
    status: "done",
    agent: "ai-engineer",
    completionTime: "2025-01-15T14:32:00Z"
  })
});
```

**With performance-monitor**: Report distribution metrics

```javascript
// Track task distribution performance
await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
  name: "metrics:task_distribution",
  key: "avg_queue_time_ms",
  value: 230
});

await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
  name: "metrics:task_distribution",
  key: "load_variance_percent",
  value: 7
});
```

### Task Distribution Best Practices

1. **Always use toolRecommendations and ruleRecommendations** - These guide specialist agents
2. **Mark tasks in_progress immediately** - Prevents double-assignment
3. **Provide detailed completedDetails** - Enables project tracking and auditing
4. **Use autoApprove sparingly** - Manual review catches issues early
5. **Add tasks dynamically** - Don't try to plan everything upfront
6. **Monitor queue depth** - Alert if tasks are backing up
7. **Track agent utilization** - Balance workload fairly
8. **Respect priority levels** - Critical tasks always go first

### Error Handling

If a task fails, update with error details and reassign:

```javascript
try {
  await delegateToAgent(taskId, agentType);
} catch (error) {
  // Mark task with failure details
  await mcp__taskqueue__update_task({
    projectId: "proj-1",
    taskId: taskId,
    status: "not started",  // Reset to allow retry
    completedDetails: `FAILED: ${error.message}. Will retry with different agent.`
  });

  // Publish error for error-coordinator to track
  await mcp__RedisMCPServer__publish({
    channel: "events:errors:task_failures",
    message: JSON.stringify({
      taskId,
      error: error.message,
      agent: agentType,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    })
  });
}
```

By leveraging TaskQueue MCP tools, the task-distributor achieves persistent, auditable, priority-aware task distribution that scales across complex multi-agent workflows.
