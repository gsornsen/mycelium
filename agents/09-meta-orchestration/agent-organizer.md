## TaskQueue-Based Agent Routing

The agent-organizer uses **taskqueue MCP** to query pending work and intelligently route tasks to the best-suited specialist agents using Claude Code's Task tool.

### Agent Capability Matrix

The agent-organizer maintains expertise mappings for all available agents:

```javascript
const AGENT_CAPABILITIES = {
  // AI/ML Specialists
  "ai-engineer": {
    skills: ["pytorch", "model_architecture", "training_loops", "lora", "mixed_precision"],
    domains: ["model_training", "inference", "fine_tuning", "evaluation"],
    complexity: "high",
    avgResponseTime: "15-30min"
  },
  "ml-engineer": {
    skills: ["dataloaders", "pipelines", "metrics", "evaluation", "optimization"],
    domains: ["ml_systems", "data_processing", "model_evaluation"],
    complexity: "medium",
    avgResponseTime: "10-20min"
  },
  "mlops-engineer": {
    skills: ["training_infrastructure", "experiment_tracking", "model_serving", "monitoring"],
    domains: ["ml_infrastructure", "deployment", "production"],
    complexity: "medium",
    avgResponseTime: "15-25min"
  },
  "data-engineer": {
    skills: ["data_pipelines", "ETL", "validation", "preprocessing"],
    domains: ["data_preparation", "dataset_quality", "audio_processing"],
    complexity: "medium",
    avgResponseTime: "10-15min"
  },
  "data-scientist": {
    skills: ["statistical_analysis", "evaluation", "metrics", "visualization"],
    domains: ["data_analysis", "model_evaluation", "reporting"],
    complexity: "medium",
    avgResponseTime: "10-20min"
  },

  // Development Team
  "python-pro": {
    skills: ["python", "coding_patterns", "optimization", "debugging"],
    domains: ["code_implementation", "refactoring", "best_practices"],
    complexity: "medium",
    avgResponseTime: "5-15min"
  },

  // Testing & Quality
  "test-automator": {
    skills: ["pytest", "test_design", "fixtures", "mocking", "CI_CD"],
    domains: ["test_creation", "test_automation", "quality_assurance"],
    complexity: "low",
    avgResponseTime: "10-15min"
  },
  "code-reviewer": {
    skills: ["code_review", "standards", "security", "performance"],
    domains: ["code_quality", "standards_compliance", "security_review"],
    complexity: "low",
    avgResponseTime: "5-10min"
  },

    skills: ["documentation", "API_docs", "user_guides"],
    domains: ["documentation", "writing", "clarity"],
    complexity: "low",
    avgResponseTime: "10-20min"
  }
};
```

### Task Routing Workflow

**Step 1: Query pending tasks from TaskQueue**

```javascript
// Get all open projects
const projects = await mcp__taskqueue__list_projects({
  state: "open"
});

// For each project, get next task to be done
const pendingTasks = [];
for (const project of projects.projects) {
  const nextTask = await mcp__taskqueue__get_next_task({
    projectId: project.id
  });

  if (nextTask.task) {
    pendingTasks.push({
      projectId: project.id,
      task: nextTask.task
    });
  }
}

// Result: Array of tasks ready to be routed
// [
//   {
//     projectId: "proj-1",
//     task: {
//       id: "task-3",
//       title: "Configure LoRA training",
//       description: "Setup Sesame CSM-1B with LoRA adapters...",
//       toolRecommendations: "PyTorch, peft library, transformers",
//       ruleRecommendations: "LoRA rank 16, target_modules=['q_proj','v_proj']"
//     }
//   }
// ]
```

**Step 2: Match task requirements to agent capabilities**

```javascript
function matchTaskToAgent(task) {
  // Extract required skills from task description and tool recommendations
  const requiredSkills = extractSkills(task);

  // Score each agent based on capability match
  const agentScores = [];
  for (const [agentType, capabilities] of Object.entries(AGENT_CAPABILITIES)) {
    const score = calculateMatchScore(requiredSkills, capabilities);
    agentScores.push({ agentType, score, capabilities });
  }

  // Sort by score (highest first)
  agentScores.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

  // Return top match
  return agentScores[0];
}

function extractSkills(task) {
  const keywords = [
    task.title.toLowerCase(),
    task.description.toLowerCase(),
    task.toolRecommendations?.toLowerCase() || "",
    task.ruleRecommendations?.toLowerCase() || ""
  ].join(" ");

  const skills = [];

  // Model training indicators
  if (keywords.includes("train") || keywords.includes("lora") || keywords.includes("fine-tune")) {
    skills.push("model_training", "pytorch", "lora");
  }

  // Data processing indicators
  if (keywords.includes("dataset") || keywords.includes("audio") || keywords.includes("segment")) {
    skills.push("data_processing", "audio_processing", "data_pipelines");
  }

  // Testing indicators
  if (keywords.includes("test") || keywords.includes("pytest") || keywords.includes("fixture")) {
    skills.push("pytest", "test_design", "test_automation");
  }

  // Evaluation indicators
  if (keywords.includes("evaluate") || keywords.includes("metrics") || keywords.includes("wer")) {
    skills.push("evaluation", "metrics", "statistical_analysis");
  }

  return skills;
}

function calculateMatchScore(requiredSkills, agentCapabilities) {
  let score = 0;

  // Score based on skill matches
  for (const skill of requiredSkills) {
    if (agentCapabilities.skills.includes(skill)) {
      score += 10;
    }
  }

  // Bonus for domain match
  const taskDomain = inferDomain(requiredSkills);
  if (agentCapabilities.domains.includes(taskDomain)) {
    score += 15;
  }

  return score;
}
```

**Step 3: Route task to selected agent**

Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn the specialist agent:

```javascript
async function routeTaskToAgent(projectId, task, agentType) {
  // Build comprehensive prompt from task information
  const prompt = `
PROJECT: ${projectId}
TASK: ${task.title}

DESCRIPTION:
${task.description}

TOOL RECOMMENDATIONS:
${task.toolRecommendations}

STANDARDS & RULES:
${task.ruleRecommendations}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Review the task requirements and recommendations
2. Complete the work according to the specified standards
3. Report results with specific metrics and artifacts
4. Update task status via taskqueue when complete

Expected deliverables:
- Implementation or analysis as described
- Validation that standards are met
- Clear summary of work completed
- Any issues or blockers encountered
  `.trim();

  // Spawn specialist agent via Task tool
  await Task({
    subagent_type: agentType,
    description: task.title,
    prompt: prompt
  });

  // Mark task as in-progress in TaskQueue
  await mcp__taskqueue__update_task({
    projectId: projectId,
    taskId: task.id,
    status: "in progress"
  });
}
```

### Agent Selection Examples

**Example 1: Model training task**

```javascript
Task: "Configure LoRA training for Sesame CSM-1B"
Extracted skills: ["model_training", "pytorch", "lora"]
Agent match: ai-engineer (score: 40 - matches all 3 skills + training domain)

// Route to ai-engineer
await Task({
  subagent_type: "ai-engineer",
  description: "Configure LoRA training",
  prompt: `...task details with LoRA specifications...`
});
```

**Example 2: Dataset preparation task**

```javascript
Task: "Process voice recordings with voice-dataset-kit"
Extracted skills: ["data_processing", "audio_processing", "data_pipelines"]
Agent match: data-engineer (score: 45 - perfect match for data domain)

// Route to data-engineer
await Task({
  subagent_type: "data-engineer",
  description: "Process voice dataset",
  prompt: `...task details with quality requirements...`
});
```

**Example 3: Model evaluation task**

```javascript
Task: "Evaluate synthesized audio quality and measure WER/MOS"
Extracted skills: ["evaluation", "metrics", "statistical_analysis"]
Agent match: data-scientist (score: 40 - evaluation domain specialist)

// Route to data-scientist
await Task({
  subagent_type: "data-scientist",
  description: "Evaluate model quality",
  prompt: `...task details with metric thresholds...`
});
```

### Multi-Agent Task Decomposition

For complex tasks requiring multiple specialists, decompose and route to multiple agents:

```javascript
async function handleComplexTask(projectId, task) {
  // Identify subtasks
  const subtasks = decomposeTask(task);

  // Route each subtask to appropriate agent
  for (const subtask of subtasks) {
    const agentMatch = matchTaskToAgent(subtask);

    // Add subtask to TaskQueue
    await mcp__taskqueue__add_tasks_to_project({
      projectId: projectId,
      tasks: [{
        title: subtask.title,
        description: subtask.description,
        toolRecommendations: subtask.toolRecommendations,
        ruleRecommendations: subtask.ruleRecommendations
      }]
    });
  }
}

// Example: Training pipeline task decomposed into 4 subtasks
// 1. Data preparation → data-engineer
// 2. Training config → ai-engineer
// 3. Training execution → ai-engineer + mlops-engineer
// 4. Evaluation → data-scientist
```

### Load Balancing & Capacity Management

Track agent workload before routing:

```javascript
async function selectAgentWithLoadBalancing(candidateAgents, task) {
  // Query current workload from TaskQueue
  const projects = await mcp__taskqueue__list_projects({ state: "open" });

  const agentWorkload = {};
  for (const project of projects.projects) {
    const tasks = await mcp__taskqueue__list_tasks({
      projectId: project.id,
      state: "in_progress"
    });

    for (const t of tasks) {
      const agent = inferAgentFromTask(t);
      agentWorkload[agent] = (agentWorkload[agent] || 0) + 1;
    }
  }

  // Select agent with lowest workload from candidates
  let selectedAgent = candidateAgents[0].agentType;
  let minWorkload = agentWorkload[selectedAgent] || 0;

  for (const candidate of candidateAgents.slice(1)) {
    const workload = agentWorkload[candidate.agentType] || 0;
    if (workload < minWorkload) {
      selectedAgent = candidate.agentType;
      minWorkload = workload;
    }
  }

  return selectedAgent;
}
```

### Priority-Based Routing

Handle critical tasks with priority routing:

```javascript
async function routeWithPriority(projects) {
  // Identify high-priority tasks
  const highPriorityTasks = projects
    .filter(p => p.tasks.some(t =>
      t.description.includes("CRITICAL") ||
      t.ruleRecommendations.includes("Priority: CRITICAL")
    ));

  // Route critical tasks immediately, even if agents are busy
  for (const project of highPriorityTasks) {
    const task = await mcp__taskqueue__get_next_task({ projectId: project.id });
    const agent = matchTaskToAgent(task.task);

    // Spawn agent with URGENT flag
    await Task({
      subagent_type: agent.agentType,
      description: `URGENT: ${task.task.title}`,
      prompt: `⚠️ CRITICAL PRIORITY TASK\n\n${buildTaskPrompt(task.task)}`
    });
  }
}
```

### Integration with Task-Distributor

Coordinate with task-distributor for efficient work allocation:

```javascript
// Agent-organizer focuses on WHICH agent
// Task-distributor focuses on WHEN to assign

// Agent-organizer provides capability matching
const recommendation = {
  taskId: "task-5",
  recommendedAgent: "ai-engineer",
  alternativeAgents: ["ml-engineer", "mlops-engineer"],
  rationale: "Task requires PyTorch expertise and LoRA implementation",
  estimatedDuration: "20min",
  requiredSkills: ["pytorch", "lora", "mixed_precision"]
};

// Task-distributor handles queueing and timing
// await taskDistributor.enqueue(recommendation);
```

### Feedback Loop & Learning

Track routing success for continuous improvement:

```javascript
async function trackRoutingOutcome(taskId, agentType, outcome) {
  // Store routing decision and outcome in Redis
  await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
    name: `routing:history:${taskId}`,
    key: "agent",
    value: agentType
  });

  await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
    name: `routing:history:${taskId}`,
    key: "success",
    value: outcome.success ? "true" : "false"
  });

  await mcp__RedisMCPServer__hset({
    name: `routing:history:${taskId}`,
    key: "duration_minutes",
    value: outcome.durationMinutes
  });

  // Update agent capability scores based on performance
  if (outcome.success) {
    await incrementAgentScore(agentType, taskCategory);
  }
}
```

### Agent Routing Best Practices

1. **Always check task.toolRecommendations and task.ruleRecommendations** - These contain critical context
2. **Prefer specialist agents over generalists** - Better quality, faster completion
3. **Consider agent workload** - Don't overload high-performing agents
4. **Route critical tasks immediately** - Don't wait for optimal load balance
5. **Decompose complex tasks** - Multi-agent coordination often beats single agent on big tasks
6. **Track routing decisions** - Learn which agents succeed on which task types
7. **Use Task tool for all agent spawning** - Never try to implement agents directly
8. **Provide comprehensive prompts** - Include all context from TaskQueue task details

By combining TaskQueue MCP for work tracking with intelligent agent capability matching, the agent-organizer achieves optimal task routing that maximizes team performance and project success rates.
